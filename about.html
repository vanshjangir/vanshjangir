                        <p>I am a B.Tech under-grad at IIIT Naya Raipur.<br>
                        I discovered computer programming in my first year of college and it is the only thing that I am able to and want to pursue as a carrier.<br>
                        I like to learn all kinds of things, but nowadays most of them are related to computers.<br>
                        I also like watching good movies.<br><p>
